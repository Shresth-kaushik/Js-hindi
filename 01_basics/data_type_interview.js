// Primitive  : jo bhi changes hote hain vo copy main not in the original data 
// Call by value. :: We do not get the original address  of the data 

// 7 types : 
// String , number , boolean ,null ,undefinied , symbol ( unique bnana k liye use hotah hai) , bigint 


// Reference type : (Non primitive )
// Array , Objects , functions 


// Java script -> Dynamic typed language 
//  This means that the data type of a variable is not explicitly declared, and it can change throughout the program. For example, you can start with a variable that is assigned a number, and then later assign it a string. This would not be possible in a statically typed language, where the data type of a variable must be declared and cannot change.
